##Git Used

##Dpendency:

1. kivy
2. numpy
3. audiostream



##PROBLEM:

Audio:
    Since using "kivy/audiostream" to do the recording. Don't know why could not create a thread and do the record in parallel. 
    So changed to record for a fix duration: 1 seconds.

edict.ini:
    Should be removed before compile. (Should overcome this issue!)

SampleButton should be defined when on_release!(rather than on_press)
