1. preprocess.py:
   1.1 Optimize the calculation of zero-cross rate.
   1.2 NIS and env_num are all related to the amount of frames now.

2. mfcc.py:
   2.1 mfcc.py have a new parameter called "appendEnergy", which will replace the first ceptral coefficient of each frame with the total frame energy when TRUE.
   2.2 Before the log, modify zero to a very small float.
   
3. dtw.py:
   3.1 Modify dtw process to a readable way.

1. preprocess.py:
   1.1 Change the interface of end_point, return a list of start-end point pairs.
   1.2 Adapt amp2, amp1, zcr2 threshold. 
   1.3 Add a new function after end point detection which is used to choose one speech segment from the result of EDP if the segment amount is more or less than one.
   1.4 Modify the shower function to show more information(threshold).
